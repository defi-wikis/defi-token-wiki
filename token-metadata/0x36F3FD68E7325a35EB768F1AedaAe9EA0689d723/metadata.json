    "description": "Empty Set Dollar (ESD) is an algorithmic stablecoin built to be the reserve currency of Decentralized Finance. The protocol is centred around an ERC-20 token: ESD. This token acts both as the stabilized dollar and as the governance token for the protocol. In order to self-stabilize, the protocol uses voluntary supply expansions and contractions around a Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) oracle from the incentivized trading pool on Uniswap.",
