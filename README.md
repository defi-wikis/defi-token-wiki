# DeFi Tokens Wiki

## Overview

There are thousands of assets in AMMs & DEXs on Ethereum, and that number will rapidly trend towards infinity.  The DeFi Tokens Wiki is a an attempt to categorize those tokens into high-signal lists and enrich them with up-to-date metadata, including:

- üíÖüèª **Logos**
- ‚úÖ **Verification Statuses** (i.e. is this *the* $UNI token or a copy-cat?)
- üóí **Short-Form Descriptions**
- üîÆ **Tags**
- üåè **Social Links**
- Much more!

**Our goal is to create the most comprehensive, collaborative corpus of information about tokens on the Ethereum blockchain (and perhaps beyond!)**

[Dharma](https://dharma.io/) pulls from this repository in their [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dharma-save-send-globally/id1495144415) on a regular basis, but any project is welcome to do the same ‚Äî this data is non-proprietary and open-source. Tokens added to this repository are also regularly published in the Dharma token list on the [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) UI.

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so *contributions are welcome*.
